## [NewYears Bootcamp Zouk Fundamentals](https://www.facebook.com/events/521677311720833/)
Friday January 17<sup>th</sup>
19.00-22.00h

We kickoff 2020 with a Zouk Fundamentals bootcamp!
In this bootcamp we will touch upon the fundamentals of Zouk,
the very foundation of this beautiful dance.
Zouk is not just a set of patterns,
but rather a complex language of which we need much more then just vocabulary.
In this bootcamp we will focus on the grammar
(techniques)
that allow us to be so versatile with the fundamental footwork patterns.
Highly recommended for Zoukers of every level!

This bootcamp is intended for:
- Fresh new Zoukers with some dancing experience who want to start dancing Zouk
- Zoukers who want to freshen up their basics
- Intermediate/Advanced followers who want to learn how to lead
- Intermediate/Advanced leaders who want to learn how to follow

**Bootcamp prices:**
<dl>
<dt>In advance</dt><dd>€30,-</dd>
<dt>Cash at the door</dt><dd>€40,-</dd>
