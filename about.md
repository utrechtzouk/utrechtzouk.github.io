## Lisa Denise van der Plaats
Lisa Denise started dancing when she was four years old.
Having had classes in numerous solo dance styles such as Jazz and Ballet throughout her youth,
she got introduced to Salsa when she started attending university in 2010.
Falling in love with partner dancing in general,
she quickly learned and expanded her repertoire with Bachata,
Kizomba,
and Merengue.
4 years later she fell in love with Brazilian Zouk,
and enthusiastically started to take classes at Dancalegria with Willem Engel.
Within a few months she also started to learn how to lead and all in all was dancing a minimum of 5 nights a week.
Falling in love with Brazilian Zouk has also inspired her to study more Brazilian dances such as Samba de Gafiera and Forro,
and she started playing around with the fusion of Zouk and West Coast Swing,
in her opinion a source of unlimited fun and opportunities!
During the year 2017 she extended her knowledge of Brazilian Zouk
and teaching in general during a year long teachers course at Dancalegria.

Lisa teaches regular classes in Utrecht,
and is known for her softness and flexibility in dance,
and technical clear concepts in teaching.
Five years later,
Lisa 3 years of teaching experience,
travelled around the world to teach at numerous Zouk congresses & festival
(amongst which: ZoukFest,
Dutch International Zouk Congress,
and Warsaw Zouk Festival
).
She continues to expand her knowledge and train with different partners to keep developing herself,
while expanding the Zouk Community in Utrecht.

## Marcos
Marcos started developing his dancing with Zouk Revolution, 
Samba,
and Forró classes during the summer of 2009 at Amsterdam based Mr. Dragon & Company.
After two years of classes there,
he was invited by Gilson and Natascha to help out during their LambaZouk classes in Amsterdam.
Where Zouk Revolution focussed on straight lines,
LambaZouk was quite the opposite.
This helped Marcos obtain a deeper understanding of the interaction between lead and follow,
completely changing the way he was used to dancing.


Marcos stopped taking regular classes in 2012 to focus on developing his own signature style
with influences of Zouk Revolution,
LambaZouk,
Samba de Gafiera (Funkeado),
and Forró.
During this time he travelled throughout Europe,
searching for new experiences,
challenges,
and talented dancers to learn from & train with.
He discovered Zouk R&B
-a relatively new style in Zouk-
closely matching his philosophies and signature-style up to that point which enabled him to incorporate it,
and make it his own.

In 2016 he got inspired by the development of Urban Kiz (Kizomba)
and started taking up regular classes.
Taking the best of Urban Kiz into his extended repertoire,
he worked together with Ruanita Santos in 2018,
training in Neo Zouk
and starting teaching workshops throughout the year.

Fast forward to January 2019,
he joined Utrecht Zouk
-partnering up with Lisa van der Plaats-
to teach our regular Utrecht based Zouk classes,
help grow our community,
continue to develop by teaching internationally,
travel abroad,
and train with multiple dancers and a variety of dance styles.
