  <h4>Tim & Sascha</h4>
  <p>
  From the moment they met they started exploring their love for partner dance.
  From Dancing,
  to performing,
  and teaching various dance styles such as:
  Salsa,
  Bachata,
  Merengue,
  and Zouk.
  Having started a Zouk scene in Edmonton
  and helped foster Zouk in West Canada at large,
  they know what it takes to build a community.
  All that experience is brought to nurture Utrecht Zouk,
  and their infectious energy helps provide a great space for learning
  during classes or one of their workshops in Holland or abroad.
