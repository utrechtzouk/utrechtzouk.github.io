### Level 1 - Beginners
This course introduces the first 8 fundamental Brazilian Zouk patterns,
the Brazilian Zouk rhythm,
Lego Blocks structure,
frame and lines.
It is a course you cannot miss!
(Even if you dance Bachata/Salsa/etc for many years!)
Brazilian Zouk is a unique dance with its own set of language rules and we are building solid foundations in this course.
Also check out the Level 1 Introduction Bootcamp below for the best kick-off to your Brazilian Zouk dance experience!

### Level 2 - Fundamentals & Footwork
This course has an A,
B,
and C variation,
which can be taken in any order.
You need the fundamentals from Level 1 to receive access to Level 2.
Want a shortcut?
If you follow the Level 1 Introduction Bootcamp you can join Level 1 and Level 2 simultaneously!
In Level 2 we continue to build strong fundamentals by introducing more footwork patterns while building our confidence through practicing changing directions,
adapting frame,
understanding lines,
and much more!

### Level 3 - Undulations & Isolations
This course has an A and B variation,
which can be taken in any order.
You need the fundamentals from Level 1,
and the practice of one course Level 2 to receive access to Level 3.
It is possible to follow Level 2 and Level 3 simultaneously.

In Level 3 we introduce the concepts of bodymovements in Brazilian Zouk,
where we mostly focus on undulations (waves, fluid movements)
and isolations (sharp, isolated movements).
We also work on our communication, body control and sensitivity.
Training these movements are absolutely vital to prepare your body for the iconic headmovements, and are a must in your Brazilian Zouk journey.

### Level 4 - Head movements
This course has an A, B and C variation, which can be taken in any order.
You need to have completed Level 1, 2 and 3 (all variations) ánd the Understanding Head movements bootcamp to receive access to Level 4.

In Level 4 we continuously work on understanding the structures of the head movements in Brazilian Zouk, training our frame response, our footwork to support the head movements and we will start to play with some variations.

### Level 5 - Advanced Lab
This course does not follow a set structure, but in this class international instructors Lisa & Marcos share the latest trends in Brazilian Zouk, offer more complex variations, and dive deeper into the fundamentals on an advanced level, to further improve the group’s level in the dance.
You need to have completed Level 1,
2,
3,
and 4 (all variations) and the Understanding Head movements bootcamp to receive access to Level 5.
