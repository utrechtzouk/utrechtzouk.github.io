Version 19<sup>th</sup> of December 2024

We offer a variety of dance opportunities in the form of progressive courses,
workshops,
bootcamps,
weekend events,
and socials.
Scroll down through this page to find all options to join us!

<i>
\*
    Levels are as indicated below,
    for some classes we do a level assessment to give everyone the best possible learning experience and growth opportunity.
    Contact us for more information.
</i>

<i>
\*\*
    We start a new beginner course 2 times per year.
    You are invited to join the Brazilian Zouk Introduction Bootcamp for the best kick-off to your Brazilian Zouk dance experience.
    Alternatively,
    it is possible to join the first class of a season as a free try-out class,
    although we highly recommend taking the bootcamp for the best experience.
    We do not allow try-out classes in any other cases as it will hinder the progress of the group.

\*\*\*
    We sadly cannot offer any refunds or credit for missed classes.
