before registering for any Utrecht Zouk course.
We count on everyone to help keep Utrecht Zouk a safe space to enjoy Brazilian Zouk.

* Stay home if you have any symptoms/don’t feel well (and get tested)!
* Only come to a dance class when you are registered and have paid.
* Be mindful of hygiene. Wash or disinfect your hands on arrival at the studio and on departure, bring your own water bottle, cough and sneeze in your elbow, etc.
* When we are not dancing, keep 1,5 m distance from each other as much as possible.
* Come to class either with a fixed partner or change partners in the group.
* Wear a face mask in the hall/stairwell of Theaterhuis de Berenkuil, even when you go to the toilet. When you enter the dance studio you can take it off. A face mask is not mandatory while dancing.
