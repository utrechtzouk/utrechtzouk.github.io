<p>
We,
the team of Utrecht Zouk,
have decided to cancel our weekly Brazilian Zouk classes both on the Wednesday's and Friday's,
starting immediately.
The classes are cancelled at least for the rest of March,
and we will monitor the situation closely to decide what to do the coming days/weeks.
</p>
<p>
We feel that it is unwise to continue weekly classes and we prefer to be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem.
Most of all,
we care deeply for our social dancing community here and everywhere around the world,
and want to keep all of you safe and healthy
‚ù§Ô∏è
but we miss you already!
</p>
<p>
As the situation for the next few days/weeks is uncertain,
we currently don‚Äôt have an answer to questions about refunds and/or rescheduled classes in the future.
I'm 100% sure we will find a solution within the coming time,
and we will communicate about that with our students as soon as we can
üôèüôè

Stay safe everyone!

## What is Brazilian Zouk?
Brazilian Zouk is a social partner dance originating from Brazil.
The dance is a descendant of the lambada,
the music & dance style that took the world by storm in the late 1980's.
Brazilian Zouk is characterized by the continuous flowing movements and the girls' flowing hair.
You can often see a close connection/embrace,
long graceful steps,
strong hip movements,
body isolations,
spins,
upper-body torsions,
and tilted upper body movements.
These movements are often called sensual due to their flow
and their origin from the core of the body.
It is danced by people of all ages in
night clubs,
dance schools,
and events around the world!
