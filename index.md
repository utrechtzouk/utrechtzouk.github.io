<p>
We,
the team of Utrecht Zouk,
have decided to cancel our weekly Brazilian Zouk classes both on the Wednesday's and Friday's,
as of the 12th of March.
The coming time we are offering Brazilian Zouk classes online,
and we will keep you updated on when we can go back to our studios again!
</p>
<p>
We care deeply for our social dancing community here and everywhere around the world,
and want to keep all of you safe and healthy
‚ù§Ô∏è
but we miss you already!
</p>
<p>
As the situation for the the coming time is uncertain,
we currently do not refunds and/or rescheduled offline classes in the (near) future.
We are determined to find a solution within the coming time,
and will inform our students as soon as possible.

## What is Brazilian Zouk?
Brazilian Zouk is a social partner dance originating from Brazil.
The dance is a descendant of the lambada,
the music & dance style that took the world by storm in the late 1980's.
Brazilian Zouk is characterized by the continuous flowing movements and the girls' flowing hair.
You can often see a close connection/embrace,
long graceful steps,
strong hip movements,
body isolations,
spins,
upper-body torsions,
and tilted upper body movements.
These movements are often called sensual due to their flow
and their origin from the core of the body.
It is danced by people of all ages in
night clubs,
dance schools,
and events around the world!
